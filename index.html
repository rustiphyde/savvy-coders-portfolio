            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>
               My name is Rusty Hoppins and I am <em>very</em> excited to welcome you to my online portfolio. I'm a <strong>creator</strong>... It's what I <em>love</em> to do.<br> I've never been able to just pick one form of art and stick with that. I've always loved to create numerous forms of art and expression. Whether it was drawing a detailed portrait with charcoal pencils, programming a complicated progressive instrumental on my mobile device or constructing a new language complete with a phonetic alphabet; as long as I was creating something new and complex, I was a happy camper.<img src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/30541772?s=460&v=4" alt="picture of Rusty Hoppins" width="300"><br><br>That's one of the reasons Web Development appeals to me so much. I am absolutely thrilled by the idea that I can make a decent living off of creating things. The fact that it just happens to be so much fun for me is just another bonus. Some people look at complicated code as a daunting task, I see it as new puzzling challenge, and I absolutely <strong>love</strong> puzzles.<br><br>The minute I discovered coding it felt like the floodgates of creativity fell wide open and I was immediately hooked in. Not once in the time I've spent learning so far has it ever felt monotonous or tedious. Every time I open my laptop the gears start turning in my creative mind, my pulse quickens and my hunger for learning increases.<br><br>I honestly feel that I have found my calling in the world of Web Development and I cannot <em>wait</em> to show the rest of the world what I am capable of. With this skillset I truly believe that the sky is the limit for me. By incorporating the skills I've already honed over the many years I've lived on this plane of existence, I know I will become a force to be reckoned with in the Developer community.<br><br>I will not be deterred, and I will not allow myself to get discouraged from making my dreams a reality. I will rise to any challenge that presents itself and I will vanquish it a hundred-fold. I know in my heart that this is what I was meant to do and come whatever may I will be the best damn developer I can be and this world is going to be inspired by my contribution to it. So get ready, Universe, because <strong>I am the future of Web Development.</strong> My name is Rusty Hoppins and I am a <strong>creator.</strong></p>
