My name is Rusty Hoppins and I am <em>very</em> excited to
    welcome you to my online portfolio. I'm a <strong>creator</strong>...
    It's what I <em>love</em> to do.<br />
    I've never been able to just pick one form of art and stick with that.
    I've always loved to create numerous forms of art and expression.
    Whether it was drawing a detailed portrait with charcoal pencils,
    programming a complicated progressive instrumental on my mobile device
    or constructing a new language complete with a phonetic alphabet; as
    long as I was creating something new and complex, I was a happy
    camper.<img

    /><br /><br />That's one of the reasons I think Web Development appeals to me
    so much. I am absolutely thrilled by the idea that I can make a decent
    living off of creating things. The fact that it just happens to be so
    much fun for me is just another bonus. Some people look at complicated
    code as a daunting task, I see it as new puzzling challenge, and I
    absolutely <strong>love</strong> puzzles.<br /><br />The minute I
    discovered coding it felt like the floodgates of creativity fell wide
    open and I was immediately hooked in.
      Not once in the time I've spent learning so far has it ever felt monotonous or tedious. Every time I
    open my laptop the gears start turning in my creative mind, my pulse
    quickens and my hunger for learning increases.<br /><br />I honestly
    feel that I have found my calling in the world of Web Development and
    I cannot <em>wait</em> to show the rest of the world what I am capable
    of. With this skillset I truly believe that the sky is the limit for
    me. By incorporating the skills I've already honed over the many years
    I've lived on this plane of existence, I know I will become a force to
    be reckoned with in the Developer community.<br /><br />I will not be
    deterred, and I will not allow myself to get discouraged from making
    my dreams a reality. I will rise to any challenge that presents itself
    and I will vanquish it a hundred-fold. I know in my heart that this is
    what I was meant to do and come whatever may I will be the best damn
    developer I can be and this world is going to be inspired by my
    contribution to it. My name is <strong>Rusty Hoppins</strong> and I am a <strong>creator!</strong></p>`;
